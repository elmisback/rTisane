# Example 1 (from summative eval dataset)
Relationships: Hypothesize Relates, Assume Causes
Data: [WA income data](examples/data/2019_WA_income.csv)
Script: [example1.R](examples/example1.R)
Notes: 
- Must disambiguate a direction even for a hypothesized relationship

# Example 2 (from summative eval dataset)
Relationships: Relates, Causes, whenThen 
Data: data

# TODO: 
- CHECK CONCEPTUAL MODEL PRIOR TO DISAMBIGUATION!
- Examples where there no hypothesize (invalidate early check)
