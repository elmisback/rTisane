# How do I use rTisane?
Specification --> Statistical modeling script --> 

1. Write program 
2. Issue query 
3. Disambiguate query
4. Run script in a separate window

# Examples
In `examples/` folder: 
- `example0.R`: 1 hypothesized causes relationship 
- `example1.R`: 1 assumed causes, 1 hypothesized relates (requires disambiguation)
- `example2.R`: 1 assumed causes, 1 assumed relates, 1 hypothesized whenThen
- `example3.R`: TO UPDATE: 1 assumed causes, 1 assumed relates, 1 ypothesize whenThen, Hypothesize interaction
- `example4.R`: TO UPDATE: Repeated measure 
- `example5.R`: TO UPDATE: Hierarchical nesting!
