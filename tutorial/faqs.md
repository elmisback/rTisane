# FAQs
1. How do I know which conceptual relationships I specify? 
Reflect on what understanding of the domain you are bringing to data analysis. Express the type of relationships as what feels most accurate to your understanding. Label each relationship according to what you want to assume or hypothesize. 

2. What is the impact of specifying conceptual relationships? What happens if I omit a variable relationship? 
The conceptual relationships help rTisane infer a statistical model that most accurately represents your conceptual knowledge and understanding of the domain. If you omit a variable relationship, the statistical model may not be applicable because it does not capture your complete conceptual understanding. 

3. Can I go back and change my relationships? 
Yes! If you become aware of conceptual relationships as you use rTisane, you should go back and add new conceptual relationships and/or update ones you already specified. Query rTisane again with this updated conceptual model.
