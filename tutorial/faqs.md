# FAQs
1. How do I know which conceptual relationships I specify? 
Reflect on what understanding of the domain you are bringing to data analysis. Use the relationship types (i.e., ``causes``, ``relates``) and labels (i.e., ``assume``, ``hypothesize``) that best match to your understanding. 

2. What is the impact of specifying conceptual relationships? What happens if I omit a variable relationship? 
There are two purposes to an rTisane program. First, the program serves to help you externalize your domain understanding. Second, rTisane uses the relationships in your program to infer a statistical model to help you answer a specific query. If you knowingly omit a variable or conceptual relationship, the statistical model may not accurately capture your complete conceptual understanding. 

3. Can I go back and change my relationships? 
Yes! If you become aware of conceptual relationships as you use rTisane, you should go back and add or update variables and conceptual relationships. Query rTisane again with this updated conceptual model.
